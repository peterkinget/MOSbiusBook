# Lab Experiments Manual

This section of the manual focuses on lab experiments for senior undergraduates in an *analog electronic circuits* class learning the fundamentals of analog transistor-level design including OTA design. 

**Preparation**

* Students are encouraged to review {cite}`tsividis_first_2002` for good circuit prototyping and measurement practices.

* Familiarize yourself with the MOSbius platform by building the blinky and/or ring oscillator experiments
