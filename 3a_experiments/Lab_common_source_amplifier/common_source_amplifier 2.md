# Common-Source Amplifier
 
 
 ```{warning}
 This is a preliminary **preview** version, updates pending
 ```
 
 You will use a breadboard, resistors, and some wires to implement a common-source amplifier. This lab is designed to investigate its DC and AC transfer characteristics. 
## Objective
* Understand the DC and AC transfer characteristics of the CS amplifier.
