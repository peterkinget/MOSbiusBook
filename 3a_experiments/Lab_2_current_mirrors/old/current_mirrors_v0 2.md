# Current Mirrors

## Objective

* Explore the operation of MOS transistors in current mirror applications
* Understand the effect of transistor sizing
* Understand the effect of drain-source voltage on mirror accuracy

## Preparation

* Review your course notes on current mirrors

## Materials

## Experiment

1. Measure 1:1 current mirror while sweeping IBIAS with large VDS
1. Measure 1:1 current mirror while sweeping VDS with fixed IBIAS 
    - estimate the DC output impedance
1. Measure 1:2, 1:4, ... current mirrors

## Suggestions

* Add a cascode transistor
    * estimate the DC output impedance
