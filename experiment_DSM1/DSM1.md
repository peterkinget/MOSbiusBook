# First-Order, Continuous-Time, Low-Pass, Delta-Sigma Modulator

We build a first-order, continuous-time (CT), low-pass delta-sigma modulator (DSM) with the MOSbius chip. A DSM is a type of analog-to-digital (ADC) converter, more specifically, an oversampling, noise-shaping converter. The analog input voltage is converted in a high-rate, clocked {1,0} bit stream that encodes the signal. With a decimation filter, the 1-bit, high-rate digital signal can be converted to a multi-bit, lower-rate digital signal while rejecting the quantization noise.
