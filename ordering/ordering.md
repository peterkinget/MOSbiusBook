# How to Order a MOSbius

We are currently (summer 2025) working hard to make MOSbius chips and PCBs available to the educational community at a nominal cost. 

If you are interested to acquire MOSbius kits, review the [express license](https://inventions.techventures.columbia.edu/technologies/mosbius-custom--CU25175) and email [Peter Kinget](mailto:pk171+mosbius@columbia.edu) for kit availability **before placing an order.**
