## Technical Discussions
- We thank Prof. Yannis Tsividis for stimulating discussions at the cradle of this project and all throughout. Thanks also to Prof. Rikky Muller, Prof. Ali Niknejad, and John Pigott for exploratory discussions on a custom chip for circuit teaching that helped shape this project. 

- We thank Dr. Babak Soltanian for his suggestion of including a switch matrix on chip. 

## Sponsors 
- The chips have been fabricated as part of the [EE6350 VLSI Design Lab](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~kinget/vlsidesignlab) at Columbia University, sponsored by Apple Inc. 
- The [Electrical Engineering Department at Columbia University](https://www.ee.columbia.edu) has been providing partial support through teaching and course assistant funding.
