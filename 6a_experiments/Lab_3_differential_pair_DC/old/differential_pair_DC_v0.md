# Differential Pair
## Objective
In this experiment, you will learn about differential signals and circuits through building and characterizing a differential pair. 

## Preparation
Review your course notes on differential signals and the theory of the operation of the differential pair.

## Materials

## Experiments

1. Measure the common-mode gain
    * measure the voltages at the drains and common source with large common-mode signal sweeps
    * determine the feasible common-mode operating range
    * determine the common-mode gain
1. Measure the differential gain
    * measure the voltages at the drains and common source with large differential signal sweeps
    * determine the linear operating range for the differential mode
    * in the linear operating mode, determine the differential gain
1. Explore the gains at increasing frequencies
    * add load capacitors (differential and single-ended)
    * add source capacitors
    * evaluate the small-signal differential-mode and common-mode gains w.r.t. frequency
1. Explore how the operation varies with changing resistors, bias current, transistor sizes. 

## Suggestions

* Run simulations of the experiments to observe the difference between simulated circuits where the transistors are perfectly identical and real-world circuits where there are small manufacturing variations between ideally designed transistors.
    * Determine the offset voltage of the differential pair

* Determine the impact of the body effect
