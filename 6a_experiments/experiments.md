# Lab Experiments Manual

This section of the manual focuses on lab experiments for senior undergraduates and first year graduate students in an *analog electronic circuits* class learning the fundamentals of analog transistor-level design including OTA design. 

**Preparation**

* Students are encouraged to review {cite}`tsividis_first_2002` for good circuit prototyping and measurement practices.

<!-- * Familiarize yourself with the MOSbius platform by building the blinky and/or ring oscillator experiments -->

**Experiments**

*NOTE:* The experiments described here do not require using the on-chip switch matrix and only use external wiring. This simplifies the logistics of running the labs.
